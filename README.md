<h1>LIRYCS VISUALISATION</h1>
<i>driven by Python 3.7 and cairo library</i><br><br>

The initial concept is to use Adobe InDesign/Illustrator templates as procedural guidelines for generating visualisations out of given data.<br>

Cyan blocks are placeholder for every piece (line), which is based on 'assets/layout.svg'

Basically, this SVG do two thingsâ€”describes positions for purely procedural elements like line chart and typograpy, and, clones SVG object (paths, circles and etc.) by using their tags and ID attribute. So, if there is a two-coins HMM under certain
block, the code selects <g> <i>(group)</i> with ID 'two', set its position <i>translate(x, y)</i>, filters links and sets category <i>(i.e. storytelling) colours.<br>
